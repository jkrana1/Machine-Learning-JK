# Machine-Learning-JK
learning-process to understand/lern data pattern to take decision
>>training (like example)- can be resembled with examples (problem with solution) given to students
>>testing (assignment, test cases)- solution or output is known
TRAINING:=> 1.DATA-in table form, numerical etc.
            2.LEARNING ALGORITHM (PROCESS TO LEARN) learning method is different with data/subject-math,language,biology
TESTING:=> to check what we learned is correct or not.

Same is done with Machine then it's called Machine Learning.
            we have to solve or find the solution

Learning is divided in 3 parts:

Supervised Learning = Where you have trained data with given output
                    Features-    Data to be trained
                    Target  -   data to be taken as an output
                Both Features & Target is given for TRAINING
                As it is supervised with training features and their output.
Example: House with its featues like location, etc., Price is defined accordingly....Price may be predicted with the
help of nearby house' sale price.

Unsupervised Learning = Data (Features) is given Output is not given during TRAINING
                OUTPUT: Features is to be learnt
Example: opened comapany, customer segmentation is done
data is grouped
Netflix groups the customers based on age,gender, country
Amazon may have diff group...

Reinforcement Learning: There's no TRAINING & OUTPUT DATA 
Example: Self Leraning
Data collected is first, 
Change/Restructure the data
You will find error..you have to correct
Here Learning with Actions
E.G. Teach pet dog./Teaching child
Based on +ve action/ -ve action

Randomness is necessary. Data during training/testing is picked up randomly otherwisem machine may go for overfitting that is like cramming 
When machine is cramming= Overfitting


Supervised Learning:=
                    Classification
                    Regression

Unsupervised Learning:= CLUSTERING      = making different groups
There are two methods of clustering:
                                    1) Hierarchical

                                    2) PARTIATIVE

Reinforcement Learning:= GENERATIVE TASK.

Classification
Class based data= Data output to be predicted as class/Categorical Data
Regression: Data output to be predicted is Numerical.


classification: is fixed in classes 
but Clustering: is not fixed based on diff featues.

CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS:
1. NAIVE BAYES  : output is predicted based on Probability, 
2. DECISION TREE: Data learning based on yes/no BRANCHES: Tree is formed, 
3. KNN (K-Nearest NEIGHBOUR): Neigbor is serched by their featues, mindset is differnet in UK, India
4. LOGISTIC REGRESSION: Uses regression techniques to classification
5. SVM -SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE: 

REGRESSION ALGORITHM: output= numerical data, continuous data: if no. is fixed then classification, and if no. is not fixed then it's regression
1. MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION = multiple values of variable such x as in y=mx+c
2. DECISION TREE : also used for regression
3. KNN: also for regression
4. SVM: also for regression


CLUSTERING: HIERARCHICAL=> devide whole dataset in 2 then again these subdatasets in 2-2 and so on....AGGLOMERATIVE ALGORITHM      
            ITERATIVE/PARTIATIVE=>   K-MEANS ALGORITHM

For spam-mail detection: more than link, image for CLASSIFICATION using their features.
Loan company- to detect the defaulter and predict him..
Weather Prediction: CLASSIFICATION, CATEGORY
Temperature Prediction: REGRESSION, NUMERICAL


NAIVE BAYES ALGO:
1.Find the problem
2. To solve that problem, find the appropriate data
3. Devide the data in two parts: Train & Test: Train to learn, Test: to test for further prection
4. Pass the data into LEARNING ALGORITHM by Checking Output to train
5. After training, pass the TEST data to predict the output
6. Validate the output to check learning status
